this is the home of the astrobot team. The grand majority of the bot is not open source, though we will be opening up some of the repos under an MIT License as time goes on. we also maintain and even are working on new discord api libraries to solve some of the issues that we are having when it comes to our goals with the bot.

we will update this readme as time goes on
